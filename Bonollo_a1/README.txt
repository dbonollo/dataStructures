Destiny Bonollo -- Program 1
Last date modified: 02/06/2014

Summary: This program inputs three pairs of (x,y) values and calculates both the correlation 
	 coefficient and strength of association. The correlation coefficient (r) is a measure
	 of "relatedness," that is, a measure that indicates whether the x-data values are
	 related (either positively, negatively, or neither) to the y-data values.

Files:
- README.txt: preliminary information (the document you are reading now)
- main.cpp: the source code, made on Visual Studio
- vitalSigns.cpp: file containing "vitalSigns" functions and returns data to main
- vitalSigns.h: header file for vitalSigns.cpp

Status: The program has been thorougly tested and is working splendidly!
